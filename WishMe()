python code:
import datetime                        
def WishME():
  hour=int(datetime.datetime.now().hour)
  if hour>=0 and hour<12:
   print ("good morning")

  elif hour >= 12 and hour <18:
        print("good afternoon")
  else:
     print("good evening")
WishME()                        $# <-here we call the WishMe() function

output:
the output will depend on time when you run this program
supoose you run this program in morning it will print"good morning"!

SO, we already know aboot speak function .lets try speak function.so ,that instead of just printing it will 
speak good morning !

python code to speak WishMe():

import datetime   
import pyttsx3
engine=pyttsx3.init('sapi5')
voices =engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice',voices[0])   #see the spea() function  so that you can use it any program you want 
                                        #
def speak(audio): 
 engine.say(audio)
 engine.runAndWait()

def WishME():
  hour=int(datetime.datetime.now().hour)
  if hour>=0 and hour<12:
    speak("good morning")

  elif hour >= 12 and hour <18:
        speak("good afternoon")
  else:
     speak("good evening")
WishME()
