def speak(audio):
 engine.say(audio)

speak("wha is your name")
 
 
Explanatoion:
 #now you can all speak() any where in your program to
 speak insted of printing example is given below:
 
 print("what is your name")          #it will print what is your name in output 
 speak("what's your name")           # it will speak what's your name
 
#you can also use speak() duing user input as follows:
as you know for text:
name=input("enter your name:")           #it will ask the name by printing enter your name .

if you use speak:

name=input(speak("enter your name:))    # it will ask the user to enter name by voice.
